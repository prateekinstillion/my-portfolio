      "Prateek Madaan is a technically strong full stack developer. I worked on a live project with him as a team member. He managed the entire Frontend of the application using latest angular version. And some of the backend as well. Plus he is very quick in learning new things. He is pragmatic, keen to small details and knows how to handle a project smartly. I wish to work with him again.",
